# BeachDrawing

This was one of my first experiences into Turtle Drawings in Python that I did along with a former classmate. It draws a scenic view of a beach side with mostly randomly generated, yet relevant shaded textures as well as random placements of various objects such as starfish. 

This code was created on Python 2.7
